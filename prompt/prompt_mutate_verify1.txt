In the previous conversations, although the IRs you modified based on my request no longer contain syntax errors, they did not fully merge all the functions from the IRs into a single one or establish data flow or calling relationships between them. Please use the context of our previous conversations and your responses to help me revise the earlier IRs, ensuring that all functions are fully merged into one, or creating data flow or calling relationships between the functions that comply with the syntax.
