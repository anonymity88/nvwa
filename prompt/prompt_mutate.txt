Assume you are a programming expert proficient in the various IR dialects and syntax within the LLVM project's MLIR framework. Please synthesize the following IR fragments into a single IR based on my request. You can merge functions in two ways: internal composition, which combines operations from multiple test cases into a single function while preserving the data flow and ensuring semantic consistency; and call composition, which integrates function logic through nested functions or by calling functions within the main function. I will first provide a sample of my expected output format, followed by several examples of the generation process, and finally present all the target IRs generated in this process.
The requirements are as follows: the generated IR must merge as many operators as possible from the provided IR fragments into one `module{}` or one "func." If the operators are not within the same `func`, there must be data flow dependencies between the `func`s, or they must be called by other functions. If it is not possible to merge all operators, prioritize the correctness of the syntax in the result, then consider adding more operators or functions.

Below is the expected output format. Please enclose the generated MLIR IRs in ```mlir and ``` as shown below:
```mlir
module {
  func.func @main -> {

  }
}
```
DISCLAIMER: "func" should not appear alone; it should be "func.func @".All affine definitions, such as "#map = affine_map<(d0, d1) -> (d0, d1)>", should be placed before the `module{}` block.

Here are some examples of the process for generating IRs:
Example 1- 
All the individual IRs required to be combined are as follows:
$IRs1$
The combined IRs: 
$combined1$

Example 2- 
All the individual IRs required to be combined are as follows:
$IRs2$
The combined IRs: 
$combined2$

Example 3- 
All the individual IRs required to be combined are as follows:
$IRs3$
The combined IRs: 
$combined3$

Target -
All the individual IRs required to be combined are as follows::
@@@@

Note: Please combine all the above IRs into a single IR based on the previous steps and examples, and establish correct data flow dependencies or calling relationships between them.
