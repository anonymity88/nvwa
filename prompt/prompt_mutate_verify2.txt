In the previous text, although the IRs you modified based on my request no longer contain syntax errors, they did not merge all the individual IRs into the same `module{}`. Please use the context of our previous conversations and your responses to help me revise the earlier IRs, ensuring that all required operators are merged into the same `module{}`, while fully complying with MLIR syntax and maintaining correct data flow dependencies between the operators.
