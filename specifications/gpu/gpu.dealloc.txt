gpu.dealloc (gpu::DeallocOp) ¶
GPU memory deallocation operation

Syntax:

operation ::= `gpu.dealloc` custom<AsyncDependencies>(type($asyncToken), $asyncDependencies)
              $memref attr-dict `:` type($memref)
The gpu.dealloc operation frees the region of memory referenced by a memref which was originally created by the gpu.alloc operation. It is similar to the memref.dealloc op, but supports asynchronous GPU execution.

The op does not execute before all async dependencies have finished executing.

If the async keyword is present, the op is executed asynchronously (i.e. it does not block until the execution has finished on the device). In that case, it returns a !gpu.async.token.

Example:

%token = gpu.dealloc async [%dep] %memref : memref<8x64xf32, 1>
