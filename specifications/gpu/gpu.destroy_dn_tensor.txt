gpu.destroy_dn_tensor (gpu::DestroyDnTensorOp) ¶
Destroy dense tensor operation

Syntax:

operation ::= `gpu.destroy_dn_tensor` custom<AsyncDependencies>(type($asyncToken), $asyncDependencies)
              $dnTensor attr-dict
The gpu.destroy_dn_tensor operation releases all resources of a dense tensor represented by a handle that was previously created by a gpu.create_dn_tensor operation.

If the async keyword is present, the op is executed asynchronously (i.e. it does not block until the execution has finished on the device). In that case, it returns a !gpu.async.token in addition to the environment.

Example:

%token = gpu.destroy_dn_tensor async [%dep] %dnTensor
Interfaces: GPU_AsyncOpInterface
