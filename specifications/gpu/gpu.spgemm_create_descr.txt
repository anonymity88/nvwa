gpu.spgemm_create_descr (gpu::SpGEMMCreateDescrOp) ¶
SpGEMM Create Descr operation

Syntax:

operation ::= `gpu.spgemm_create_descr` custom<AsyncDependencies>(type($asyncToken), $asyncDependencies)
              attr-dict
The gpu.spgemm_create_descr creates a descriptor for the SpGEMM operation. The descriptor describes the SpGEMM operation and stores the internal data throughout the computation. It needs to be passed as an argument to spgemm_* operations.

If the async keyword is present, the op is executed asynchronously (i.e. it does not block until the execution has finished on the device). In that case, it returns a !gpu.async.token in addition to the environment.

Example:

%desc, %token = gpu.spgemm_create_descr async [%dep]
