gpu.destroy_sp_mat (gpu::DestroySpMatOp) ¶
Destroy sparse matrix operation

Syntax:

operation ::= `gpu.destroy_sp_mat` custom<AsyncDependencies>(type($asyncToken), $asyncDependencies) $spmat attr-dict
The gpu.destroy_sp_mat operation releases all resources of a sparse matrix represented by a handle that was previously created by a one of the sparse matrix creation operations.

If the async keyword is present, the op is executed asynchronously (i.e. it does not block until the execution has finished on the device). In that case, it returns a !gpu.async.token in addition to the environment.

Example:

%token = gpu.destroy_sp_mat async [%dep] %spmat
Interfaces: GPU_AsyncOpInterface
