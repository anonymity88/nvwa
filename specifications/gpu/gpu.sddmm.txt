gpu.sddmm (gpu::SDDMMOp) ¶
SDDMM operation

Syntax:

operation ::= `gpu.sddmm` custom<AsyncDependencies>(type($asyncToken), $asyncDependencies)
              $dnmatA (`{` $modeA^ `}`)? `,` $dnmatB (`{` $modeB^ `}`)? `,` $spmatC `,` $buffer attr-dict `:` type($buffer) `into` $computeType
The gpu.sddmm operation performs the SDDMM operation on the given sparse and dense matrices, and buffer. The operation expects handles returned by previous sparse operations to construct an environment and the operands for SDDMM. The buffer must have been allocated on the device.

If the async keyword is present, the op is executed asynchronously (i.e. it does not block until the execution has finished on the device). In that case, it returns a !gpu.async.token in addition to the environment.

Example:

%token = gpu.sddmm async [%dep] %dnmatA{TRANSPOSE}, %dnmatB{TRANSPOSE}, %spmatC, %buffer into f32
The matrix arguments can also be associated with one of the following operators: NON_TRANSPOSE, TRANSPOSE, CONJUGATE_TRANSPOSE. The default value is NON_TRANSPOSE.
