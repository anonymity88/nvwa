gpu.subgroup_reduce (gpu::SubgroupReduceOp) ¶
Reduce values among subgroup.

Syntax:

operation ::= `gpu.subgroup_reduce` custom<AllReduceOperation>($op) $value
              (`uniform` $uniform^)?
              (`cluster` `(` `size` `=` $cluster_size^ (`,` `stride` `=` $cluster_stride^)? `)`)?
              attr-dict
              `:` functional-type(operands, results)
The subgroup_reduce op reduces the values of lanes (work items) across a subgroup.

The subgroup is divided into clusters starting at lane index 0. Within each cluster, there are size lanes, and the lane index advances by stride. A reduction is done for each cluster in parallel: every lane in the cluster is reduced, and the result is equal for all lanes in the cluster. If size is omitted, there is a single cluster covering the entire subgroup. If stride is omitted, the stride is 1 (the cluster’s lanes are contiguous).

When the reduced value is of a vector type, each vector element is reduced independently. Only 1-d vector types are allowed.

Example:

%1 = gpu.subgroup_reduce add %a : (f32) -> f32
%2 = gpu.subgroup_reduce add %b : (vector<4xf16>) -> vector<4xf16>
%3 = gpu.subgroup_reduce add %c cluster(size = 4) : (f32) -> f32
%3 = gpu.subgroup_reduce add %c cluster(size = 4, stride = 2) : (f32) -> f32
If uniform flag is set either none or all lanes of a subgroup need to execute this op in convergence.

The reduction operation must be one of:

Integer types: add, mul, minui, minsi, maxui, maxsi, and, or, xor
Floating point types: add, mul, minnumf, maxnumf, minimumf, maximumf
Traits: SameOperandsAndResultType

Interfaces: InferTypeOpInterface
