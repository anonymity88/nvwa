gpu.spgemm_destroy_descr (gpu::SpGEMMDestroyDescrOp) ¶
SpGEMM Destroy Descr operation

Syntax:

operation ::= `gpu.spgemm_destroy_descr` custom<AsyncDependencies>(type($asyncToken), $asyncDependencies)
              $desc attr-dict
The gpu.spgemm_destroy_descr destroys the SpGEMM operation descriptor.

If the async keyword is present, the op is executed asynchronously (i.e. it does not block until the execution has finished on the device). In that case, it returns a !gpu.async.token in addition to the environment.

Example:

%token = gpu.spgemm_destroy_descr async [%dep] %desc
Interfaces: GPU_AsyncOpInterface
