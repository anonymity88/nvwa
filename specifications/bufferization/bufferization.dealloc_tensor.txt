bufferization.dealloc_tensor (bufferization::DeallocTensorOp) ¶
Release underlying storage format of given tensor

Syntax:

operation ::= `bufferization.dealloc_tensor` $tensor attr-dict `:` type($tensor)
bufferization.dealloc_tensor is a buffer deallocation in tensor land. This op can be used for manual buffer deallocation. Some bufferizations (such as One-Shot Bufferize) take care of buffer deallocation, in which case this op is usually not needed. Details can be found in the documentation of the respective bufferization passes.

In case of a dense tensor, this op lowers to a memref.dealloc op during bufferization.

In case of a sparse tensor, this op releases the underlying sparse storage format for a tensor that materialized earlier through a new operation, a convert operation with annotated destination tensor type (unless the convert is folded away), or a bufferization.alloc_tensor operation. The release operation should only be called once for any materialized tensor. After this operation, any subsequent memref querying operation on the tensor returns undefined results.

Example:

bufferization.dealloc_tensor %tensor : tensor<1024x1024xf64, #CSR>
