irdl.results (irdl::ResultsOp) ¶
Define the results of an operation

Syntax:

operation ::= `irdl.results` `` custom<ValuesWithVariadicity>($args, $variadicity) attr-dict
irdl.results define the results of the irdl.operation parent operation definition.

In the following example, irdl.results defines the results of the norm operation:

irdl.dialect @cmath {

  irdl.type @complex { /* ... */ }

  irdl.operation @get_values {
    %0 = irdl.any
    %1 = irdl.parametric @cmath::@complex<%0>
    irdl.results(%0, %0)
    irdl.operands(%1)
  }
}
The operation will expect one operand of the cmath.complex type, and two results that have the underlying type of the cmath.complex.

The results can also be marked as variadic or optional:

irdl.results(%0, single %1, optional %2, variadic %3)
Here, %0 and %1 are required single results, %2 is an optional result, and %3 is a variadic result.

When more than one result is marked as optional or variadic, the operation will expect a ‘resultSegmentSizes’ attribute that defines the number of results in each segment.
