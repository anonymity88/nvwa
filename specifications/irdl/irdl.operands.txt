irdl.operands (irdl::OperandsOp) ¶
Define the operands of an operation

Syntax:

operation ::= `irdl.operands` `` custom<ValuesWithVariadicity>($args, $variadicity) attr-dict
irdl.operands define the operands of the irdl.operation parent operation definition.

In the following example, irdl.operands defines the operands of the norm operation:

irdl.dialect @cmath {

  irdl.type @complex { /* ... */ }

  irdl.operation @mul {
    %0 = irdl.any
    %1 = irdl.parametric @cmath::@complex<%0>
    irdl.results(%1)
    irdl.operands(%1, %1)
  }
}
The mul operation will expect two operands of type cmath.complex, that have the same type, and return a result of the same type.

The operands can also be marked as variadic or optional:

irdl.operands(%0, single %1, optional %2, variadic %3)
Here, %0 and %1 are required single operands, %2 is an optional operand, and %3 is a variadic operand.

When more than one operand is marked as optional or variadic, the operation will expect a ‘operandSegmentSizes’ attribute that defines the number of operands in each segment.
