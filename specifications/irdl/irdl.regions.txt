irdl.regions (irdl::RegionsOp) ¶
Define the regions of an operation

Syntax:

operation ::= `irdl.regions` `(` $args `)` attr-dict
irdl.regions defines the regions of an operation by accepting values produced by irdl.region operation as arguments.

Example:

irdl.dialect @example {
  irdl.operation @op_with_regions {
    %r1 = irdl.region with size 3
    %0 = irdl.any
    %r2 = irdl.region(%0)
    irdl.regions(%r1, %r2)
  }
}
In the snippet above the operation is constrained to have two regions. The first region should contain three blocks. The second region should have one region with one argument.
