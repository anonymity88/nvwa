irdl.operation (irdl::OperationOp) ¶
Define a new operation

Syntax:

operation ::= `irdl.operation` $sym_name attr-dict-with-keyword custom<SingleBlockRegion>($body)
irdl.operation defines a new operation belonging to the irdl.dialect parent.

Operations can define constraints on their operands and results with the irdl.results and irdl.operands operations. If these operations are not present in the region, the results or operands are expected to be empty.

Example:

irdl.dialect @cmath {

  irdl.type @complex { /* ... */ }

  irdl.operation @norm {
    %0 = irdl.any
    %1 = irdl.parametric @cmath::@complex<%0>
    irdl.results(%0)
    irdl.operands(%1)
  }
}
The above program defines an operation norm inside the dialect cmath. The operation expects a single operand of base type cmath.complex, and returns a single result of the element type of the operand.
