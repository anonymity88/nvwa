arm_sve.sdot (arm_sve::SdotOp) ¶
Vector-vector dot product and accumulate op

Syntax:

operation ::= `arm_sve.sdot` $acc `,` $src1 `,` $src2 attr-dict `:` type($src1) `to` type($dst)
SDOT: Signed integer addition of dot product.

This function maps to the SDOT instruction, and it takes signless integer operands that the operation interprets as signed. It partitions the second and third vector inputs into groups of four elements. They calculate the dot product of each group (without loss of precision) and then add each result to the overlapping element of the first vector input.
