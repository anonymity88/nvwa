omp.ordered.region (omp::OrderedRegionOp) ¶
Ordered construct with region

Syntax:

operation ::= `omp.ordered.region` oilist(
              `par_level_simd` $par_level_simd
              ) $region attr-dict
The ordered construct with region specifies a structured block in a worksharing-loop, SIMD, or worksharing-loop SIMD region that is executed in the order of the loop iterations.

The par_level_simd attribute corresponds to the simd clause specified. If it is not present, it behaves as if the threads clause is specified or no clause is specified.
