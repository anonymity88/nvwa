omp.critical (omp::CriticalOp) ¶
Critical construct

Syntax:

operation ::= `omp.critical` (`(` $name^ `)`)? $region attr-dict
The critical construct imposes a restriction on the associated structured block (region) to be executed by only a single thread at a time.

The optional name argument of critical constructs is used to identify them. Unnamed critical constructs behave as though an identical name was specified.
