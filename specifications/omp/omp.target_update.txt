omp.target_update (omp::TargetUpdateOp) ¶
Target update construct

Syntax:

operation ::= `omp.target_update` oilist(
              `depend` `(`
              custom<DependVarList>($depend_vars, type($depend_vars), $depend_kinds) `)`
              |
              `device` `(` $device `:` type($device) `)`
              |
              `if` `(` $if_expr `)`
              |
              `map_entries` `(` $map_vars `:` type($map_vars) `)`
              |
              `nowait` $nowait
              ) attr-dict
The target update directive makes the corresponding list items in the device data environment consistent with their original list items, according to the specified motion clauses. The target update construct is a stand-alone directive.

The optional if_expr parameter specifies a boolean result of a conditional check. If this value is 1 or is not provided then the target region runs on a device, if it is 0 then the target region is executed on the host device.

We use MapInfoOp to model the motion clauses and their modifiers. Even though the spec differentiates between map-types & map-type-modifiers vs. motion-clauses & motion-modifiers, the motion clauses and their modifiers are a subset of map types and their modifiers. The subset relation is handled in during verification to make sure the restrictions for target update are respected.

The depend_kinds and depend_vars arguments are variadic lists of values that specify the dependencies of this particular task in relation to other tasks.

The optional device parameter specifies the device number for the target region.

The optional map_vars maps data from the current task’s data environment to the device data environment.

The optional nowait attribute, when present, eliminates the implicit barrier at the end of the construct, so the parent operation can make progress even if the child operation has not completed yet.
