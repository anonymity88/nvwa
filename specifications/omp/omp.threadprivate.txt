omp.threadprivate (omp::ThreadprivateOp) ¶
Threadprivate directive

Syntax:

operation ::= `omp.threadprivate` $sym_addr `:` type($sym_addr) `->` type($tls_addr) attr-dict
The threadprivate directive specifies that variables are replicated, with each thread having its own copy.

The current implementation uses the OpenMP runtime to provide thread-local storage (TLS). Using the TLS feature of the LLVM IR will be supported in future.

This operation takes in the address of a symbol that represents the original variable and returns the address of its TLS. All occurrences of threadprivate variables in a parallel region should use the TLS returned by this operation.

The sym_addr refers to the address of the symbol, which is a pointer to the original variable.
