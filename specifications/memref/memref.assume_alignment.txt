memref.assume_alignment (memref::AssumeAlignmentOp) ¶
Assertion that gives alignment information to the input memref

Syntax:

operation ::= `memref.assume_alignment` $memref `,` $alignment attr-dict `:` type($memref)
The assume_alignment operation takes a memref and an integer of alignment value, and internally annotates the buffer with the given alignment. If the buffer isn’t aligned to the given alignment, the behavior is undefined.

This operation doesn’t affect the semantics of a correct program. It’s for optimization only, and the optimization is best-effort.
