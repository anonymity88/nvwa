shape.cstr_require (shape::CstrRequireOp) ¶
Represents a runtime assertion that an i1 is true

Syntax:

operation ::= `shape.cstr_require` $pred `,` $msg attr-dict
Represents a runtime assertion that an i1 is true. It returns a !shape.witness to order this assertion.

For simplicity, prefer using other cstr_* ops if they are available for a given constraint.

Example:

%bool = ...
%w0 = shape.cstr_require %bool, "msg" // Passing if `%bool` is true.
Since this op can be used to express many different possible assertions (depending on whatever computation calculated pred), the msg should clarify the nature of the assertion for users.
