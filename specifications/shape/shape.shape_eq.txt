shape.shape_eq (shape::ShapeEqOp) ¶
Returns whether the input shapes or extent tensors are equal

Syntax:

operation ::= `shape.shape_eq` $shapes attr-dict `:` type($shapes)
Takes one or more shape or extent tensor operands and determines whether they are equal. When extent tensors are compared to shapes they are regarded as their equivalent non-error shapes. Error shapes can be tested for equality like any other shape value, meaning that the error value is equal to itself.
