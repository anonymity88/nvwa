shape.cstr_broadcastable (shape::CstrBroadcastableOp) ¶
Determines if 2+ shapes can be successfully broadcasted

Syntax:

operation ::= `shape.cstr_broadcastable` $shapes attr-dict `:` type($shapes)
Given input shapes or extent tensors, return a witness specifying if they are broadcastable. This broadcastable follows the same logic as what shape.broadcast documents.

“cstr” operations represent runtime assertions.

Example:

%w0 = shape.cstr_broadcastable [2,2], [3,1,2] // Passing
%w1 = shape.cstr_broadcastable [2,2], [3,2] // Failure
