shape.is_broadcastable (shape::IsBroadcastableOp) ¶
Determines if 2+ shapes can be successfully broadcasted

Syntax:

operation ::= `shape.is_broadcastable` $shapes attr-dict `:` type($shapes)
Given multiple input shapes or extent tensors, return a predicate specifying if they are broadcastable. This broadcastable follows the same logic as what shape.broadcast documents.

Concretely, shape.is_broadcastable returning true implies that shape.broadcast will not give an error, and shape.cstr_broadcastable will not result in an assertion failure. Similarly, false implies an error or assertion failure.

Example:

%true = shape.is_broadcastable [2,2], [3,1,2]
%false = shape.is_broadcastable [2,2], [3,2]
