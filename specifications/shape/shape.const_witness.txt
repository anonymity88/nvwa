shape.const_witness (shape::ConstWitnessOp) ¶
An operation that returns a statically known witness value

Syntax:

operation ::= `shape.const_witness` $passing attr-dict
This operation represents a statically known witness result. This can be often used to canonicalize/fold constraint and assuming code that will always pass.

%0 = shape.const_shape [1,2,3]
%1 = shape.const_shape [1,2,3]
%w0 = shape.cstr_eq(%0, %1) // Can be folded to "const_witness true"
%w1 = shape.const_witness true
%w2 = shape.assuming_all(%w0, %w2) // Can be folded to "const_witness true"
