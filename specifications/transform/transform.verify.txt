transform.verify (transform::VerifyOp) ¶
Verifies the targeted ops

Syntax:

operation ::= `transform.verify` $target attr-dict `:` type($target)
This transform verifies the targeted ops. If at least one op fails to verify, the transform produces a definite failure.

Note: This op was designed for debugging purposes and should be used like an assertion. It is intentional that this op produces a definite failure and not a silenceable one. Correctness of the program should not depend on this op.

This transform reads the target handle.
