transform.match.structured.rank (transform::MatchStructuredRankOp) ¶
Captures the rank of a structured operation as parameter

Syntax:

operation ::= `transform.match.structured.rank` $operand_handle attr-dict `:`
              custom<SemiFunctionType>(type($operand_handle), type($rank), "false")
Produces a transform dialect parameter value associated with an integer attribute containing the rank of the structured payload operation associated with the operand handle.

This op can only appear immediately inside a transform.match.structured op and apply to its first block argument because it assumes the payload to have been already checked for being a single structured op.

Return modes ¶
Succeeds if the operand is associated with exactly one structured payload operation. Produces a silenceable failure otherwise.

Traits: SingleOpMatcher, StructuredPredicate
