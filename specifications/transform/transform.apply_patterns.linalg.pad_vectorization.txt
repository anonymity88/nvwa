transform.apply_patterns.linalg.pad_vectorization (transform::ApplyPadVectorizationPatternsOp) Â¶
Syntax:

operation ::= `transform.apply_patterns.linalg.pad_vectorization` attr-dict
Apply patterns that vectorize tensor.pad.

These patterns rewrite tensor.pad Ops using vector.transfer_read and vector.transfer_write operations. This is done either by:

Folding tensor.pad with an existing vector.transfer_read / vector.transfer_write Op (generated prior to running these patterns).
Rewriting it (when matched together with q tensor.insert_slice consumer Op) as a vector.transfer_read + vector.transfer_write pair.
In both cases, these patterns look at producers and consumers for the matched tensor.pad Op to find opportunities for vectorization.
