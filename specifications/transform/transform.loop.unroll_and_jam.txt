transform.loop.unroll_and_jam (transform::LoopUnrollAndJamOp) ¶
Unrolls and jam the given loop with the given unroll factor

Syntax:

operation ::= `transform.loop.unroll_and_jam` $target attr-dict `:` type($target)
Unrolls & jams each loop associated with the given handle to have up to the given number of loop body copies per iteration. If the unroll factor is larger than the loop trip count, the latter is used as the unroll factor instead.

Return modes ¶
This operation ignores non-scf.for, non-affine.for ops and drops them in the return. If all the operations referred to by the target operand unroll properly, the transform succeeds. Otherwise the transform produces a silenceable failure.

Does not return handles as the operation may result in the loop being removed after a full unrolling.
