transform.type_conversion.tensor.cast_shape_dynamic_dims (transform::TypeConversionCastShapeDynamicDimsOp) ¶
Syntax:

operation ::= `transform.type_conversion.tensor.cast_shape_dynamic_dims` (`ignore_dynamic_info` $ignore_dynamic_info^)? attr-dict
Populates a type converter with conversion materialization functions that cast a tensor value between two cast-compatible tensors. See tensor.cast for more information on cast compatibility between tensors.

If ignore_dynamic_info is not set, this will set an additional constraint that source materializations do not cast dynamic dimensions to static ones.
