transform.apply_patterns.vector.lower_masks (transform::ApplyLowerMasksPatternsOp) Â¶
Syntax:

operation ::= `transform.apply_patterns.vector.lower_masks` attr-dict
Indicates that vector.create_mask and vector.constant_mask operations should be lowered to finer-grained vector primitives.

This is usually a late step that is run after bufferization as part of the process of lowering to e.g. LLVM or NVVM.
