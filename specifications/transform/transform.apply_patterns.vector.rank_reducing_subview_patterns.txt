transform.apply_patterns.vector.rank_reducing_subview_patterns (transform::ApplyRankReducingSubviewPatternsOp) Â¶
Syntax:

operation ::= `transform.apply_patterns.vector.rank_reducing_subview_patterns` attr-dict
Apply opt-in vector transfer permutation patterns that include:

TransferReadDropUnitDimsPattern
TransferWriteDropUnitDimsPattern
These patterns have the effect of rewriting a vector.transfer with unit dimensions into a rank-reduced version thanks to subview operations. This is complemented by shape_cast folding patterns.
