Syntax:

operation ::= `transform.apply_patterns.vector.lower_contraction` (`lowering_strategy` `=` $lowering_strategy^)? attr-dict
Indicates that vector contraction-like operations should be lowered to finer-grained vector primitives.

This is usually a late step that is run after bufferization as part of the process of lowering to e.g. LLVM or NVVM.
