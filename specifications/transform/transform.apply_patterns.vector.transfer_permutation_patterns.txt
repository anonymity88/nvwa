transform.apply_patterns.vector.transfer_permutation_patterns (transform::ApplyTransferPermutationPatternsOp) Â¶
Syntax:

operation ::= `transform.apply_patterns.vector.transfer_permutation_patterns` attr-dict
Apply opt-in vector transfer permutation patterns that include:

TransferReadPermutationLowering
TransferWritePermutationLowering
TransferOpReduceRank
TransferWriteNonPermutationLowering
These patterns have the effect of rewriting a vector.transfer with an arbitrary permutation_map to a vector.transfer with a permutation_map that is a minor identity followed by a vector.transpose.

In other words, this makes the vector.transfer contiguous on the most minor dimensions and materializes the permutation_map as a vector.transpose.
