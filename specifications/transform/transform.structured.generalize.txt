transform.structured.generalize (transform::GeneralizeOp) ¶
Syntax:

operation ::= `transform.structured.generalize` $target attr-dict `:`
              custom<SemiFunctionType>(type($target), type($transformed), "false")
Transforms a named structured operation into the generic form with the explicit attached region.

Return modes ¶
This operation ignores non-Linalg ops and drops them in the return. If all the operations referred to by the target handle generalize properly, the transform succeeds. Otherwise the transform produces a silenceable failure. The return handle points to only the subset of successfully produced equivalent generic operations, which can be empty or contain the original ops if they were already in generic form.
