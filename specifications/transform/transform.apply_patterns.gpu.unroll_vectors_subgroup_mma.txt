transform.apply_patterns.gpu.unroll_vectors_subgroup_mma (transform::ApplyUnrollVectorsSubgroupMmaOp) ¶
Syntax:

operation ::= `transform.apply_patterns.gpu.unroll_vectors_subgroup_mma` `[` $m `,` $n `,` $k `]` attr-dict
Unrolls contractions to the target m, n, and k native vector size, along with other vector operations based on expected usage. transfer_read ops unroll based on the extract slice shape introduced by unrolling the contractions, while elementwise and transfer_write ops unroll to the shape of the C matrix (m x n).

This operation applies to pure vector operations and should be applied before lowering to subgroup_mma ops.
