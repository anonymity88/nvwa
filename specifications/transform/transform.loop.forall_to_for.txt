transform.loop.forall_to_for (transform::ForallToForOp) ¶
Converts scf.forall into a nest of scf.for operations

Syntax:

operation ::= `transform.loop.forall_to_for` $target attr-dict `:` functional-type(operands, results)
Converts the scf.forall operation pointed to by the given handle into a set of nested scf.for operations. Each new operation corresponds to one induction variable of the original “multifor” loop.

The operand handle must be associated with exactly one payload operation.

Loops with shared outputs are currently not supported.

Return Modes ¶
Consumes the operand handle. Produces a silenceable failure if the operand is not associated with a single scf.forall payload operation. Returns as many handles as the given forall op has induction variables that are associated with the generated scf.for loops. Produces a silenceable failure if another number of resulting handles is requested.
