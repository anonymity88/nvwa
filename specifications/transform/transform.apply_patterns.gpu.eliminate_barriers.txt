transform.apply_patterns.gpu.eliminate_barriers (transform::EliminateBarriersOp) ¶
Syntax:

operation ::= `transform.apply_patterns.gpu.eliminate_barriers` attr-dict
Removes unnecessary GPU barriers from the function. If a barrier does not enforce any conflicting pair of memory effects, including a pair that is enforced by another barrier, it is unnecessary and can be removed.

The approach is based on “High-Performance GPU-to-CPU Transpilation and Optimization via High-Level Parallel Constructs” by Moses, Ivanov, Domke, Endo, Doerfert, and Zinenko in PPoPP 2023. Specifically, it analyzes the memory effects of the operations before and after the given barrier and checks if the barrier enforces any of the memory effect-induced dependencies that aren’t already enforced by another barrier.

For example, in the following code

  store %A
  barrier  // enforces load-after-store
  load %A
  barrier  // load-after-store already enforced by the previous barrier
  load %A
the second barrier can be removed.
