transform.match.structured.input (transform::MatchStructuredInputOp) ¶
Captures input operand(s) of a structured operation

Syntax:

operation ::= `transform.match.structured.input` $operand_handle `[`custom<TransformMatchDims>($raw_position_list, $is_inverted, $is_all)`]` attr-dict `:` custom<SemiFunctionType>(type($operand_handle), type($result))
Produces a transform dialect value depending on the result type:

If the result type is a value handle, it will be associated with the input operand(s) of the payload operation associated with the operand handle.
If the result type is an operation handle, it will be associated with the operation defining the input operand(s) of the payload operation associated with the operand handle.
If the result type is an affine map parameter type, it will be associated with the indexing map that corresponds to the input operand(s) of the payload operation associated with the operand handle.
For example, given the following operation:

%arg1 = some.op
linalg.matmul ins(%arg1, %arg2 : ...) outs(%arg3 : ...)
in case of a successful match for operand 0 this operation will return, for each of the respective cases above:

A handle to %arg1 if the result is a value handle.
A handle to some.op if the result is an operation handle.
A parameter containing the LHS map of the matrix multiplication, i.e. affine_map<(d0, d1, d2) -> (d0, d2)> if the result is an affine map parameter.
The match succeeds if the conditions specified as attributes succeed.

The following input specifications are supported:

all: all inputs are checked and captured;
list of integers: the listed inputs are checked and captured;
except( list of integers ): all inputs except the specified ones are checked and captured.
Negative indexes are interpreted by counting values from the last one (similarly to Python). For example, -1 means the last input and except(-1) means all inputs but the last. Indexes must be unique, including after interpretation of negative ones.

Produces a silenceable failure in case of index overflow, including backward counting.

This op can only appear immediately inside a transform.match.structured op and apply to its first block argument because it assumes the payload to have been already checked for being a single structured op.

Return modes ¶
Succeeds if all input indexes are in bounds, produces a silenceable failure otherwise. Additionally, when the result is an operation handle, produces a silenceable failure if the input specification defines more than one input or if the operand is not an operation result.
