transform.apply_patterns.vector.interleave_to_shuffle (transform::ApplyInterleaveToShufflePatternsOp) Â¶
Syntax:

operation ::= `transform.apply_patterns.vector.interleave_to_shuffle` attr-dict
Indicates that 1D vector interleave operations should be rewritten as vector shuffle operations.

This is motivated by some current codegen backends not handling vector interleave operations.
