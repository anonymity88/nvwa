transform.tensor.make_loop_independent (transform::MakeLoopIndependentOp) ¶
Syntax:

operation ::= `transform.tensor.make_loop_independent` $target attr-dict `:` functional-type($target, $transformed)
Rewrite the targeted ops such that their index-typed operands no longer depend on any loop induction variable of the num_loop enclosing scf.for loops. I.e., compute an upper bound that is independent of any such loop IV for every tensor dimension. The transformed op could then be hoisted from the num_loop enclosing loops. To preserve the original semantics, place a tensor.extract_slice inside the loop.

Currently supported operations are:

tensor.empty: Replaced with a new tensor.empty with upper bound sizes, followed by a tensor.extract_slice.
tensor.pad: Replaced by an upper bound padding, followed by a tensor.extract_slice.
Return modes ¶
This operation fails if at least one induction variable could not be eliminated. In case the targeted op is already independent of induction variables, this transform succeeds and returns the unmodified target op.

Otherwise, the returned handle points to a subset of the produced ops:

tensor.empty: The returned handle points to the tensor.extract_slice op.
tensor.pad: The returned handle points to the tensor.extract_slice op.
This transform op consumes the target handle and produces a result handle.
