transform.match.structured.body (transform::MatchStructuredBodyOp) ¶
Checks if the body of the structured op satisfies some criteria

Syntax:

operation ::= `transform.match.structured.body` $operand_handle attr-dict `:` type($operand_handle)
Checks if the body of the structured payload op satisfies one of the following mutually exclusive criteria specified by attributes:

reduction_position: the body of the structured payload op implements a reduction of the n-th operand (n is the value of the attribute) using a single combiner operation;

passthrough: the body of the structured payload op only forwards inputs to the outputs (copy or broadcast).

elementwise: the body of the structured payload op represents an elementwise operation.

contraction: the body of the structured payload op is a contraction of the form <red>(<elem>(bbarg0, bbarg1), bbarg2) where <elem> and <red> are binary operations whose names are specified in the attribute and operands can be permuted and optionally forwarded through a chain of unary side effect-free operations.

This op can only appear immediately inside a transform.match.structured op and apply to its first block argument because it assumes the payload to have been already checked for being a single structured op.

Return modes ¶
Succeeds if the operation body satisfies the specified criteria, produces a silenceable failure otherwise. Produces a definite failure if the operand is not associated with a single payload op.
