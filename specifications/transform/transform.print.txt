transform.print (transform::PrintOp) ¶
Dump each payload op

Syntax:

operation ::= `transform.print` $target attr-dict (`:` type($target)^)?
Prints each payload op that is associated with the target operand to stdout. It also prints the name string attribute. If no target is specified, the top-level op is dumped.

This op is useful for printf-style debugging.

Supported printing flag attributes:

assume_verified – skips verification when the unit attribute is specified. This improves performace but may lead to crashes and unexpected behavior when the printed payload op is invalid.
use_local_scope – prints in local scope when the unit attribute is specified. This improves performance but may not be identical to printing within the full module.
skip_regions – does not print regions of operations when the unit attribute is specified.
Interfaces: MatchOpInterface, MemoryEffectOpInterface, TransformOpInterface
