transform.loop.forall_to_parallel (transform::ForallToParallelOp) ¶
Converts scf.forall into a nest of scf.for operations

Syntax:

operation ::= `transform.loop.forall_to_parallel` $target attr-dict `:` functional-type(operands, results)
Converts the scf.forall operation pointed to by the given handle into an scf.parallel operation.

The operand handle must be associated with exactly one payload operation.

Loops with outputs are not supported.

Return Modes ¶
Consumes the operand handle. Produces a silenceable failure if the operand is not associated with a single scf.forall payload operation. Returns a handle to the new scf.parallel operation. Produces a silenceable failure if another number of resulting handles is requested.
