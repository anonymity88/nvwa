transform.match.structured.num_inits (transform::MatchStructuredNumInitsOp) ¶
Captures the number of init(outs) operands of a structuredoperation as parameter

Syntax:

operation ::= `transform.match.structured.num_inits` $operand_handle attr-dict `:` functional-type(operands, results)
Produces a transform dialect parameter value associated with an integer attribute containing the number of init(outs) operands of the payload operation associated with the operand handle.

This op can only appear immediately inside a transform.match.structured op and apply to its first block argument because it assumes the payload to have been already checked for being a single structured op.

Return modes ¶
Succeeds if the operand is associated with exactly one structured payload operation. Produces a silenceable failure otherwise.

Traits: SingleOpMatcher, StructuredPredicate
