transform.structured.vectorize_children_and_apply_patterns (transform::VectorizeChildrenAndApplyPatternsOp) ¶
Syntax:

operation ::= `transform.structured.vectorize_children_and_apply_patterns` $target attr-dict `:`functional-type(operands, results)
Vectorizes all children contained in the given target using the configuration specified by the attributes of this op. This only vectorizes structured ops that operate on shaped types and does not vectorize loops or straight-line. Internally, it applies a set of rewrite patterns, some of which enable vectorization and some of which clean up the results. Therefore, it can only be applied to an op with the “isolated from above” property. This transformation only fails if the entire pattern rewriting failed, i.e., it does not fail when no ops were vectorized.

Finer granularity can be achieved either with the VectorizeOp for individual ops or by outlining the target part of the payload IR into, e.g., a function, performing this transformation, and inlining it back.

Note that this transformation invalidates the handles to any payload IR operation that is contained inside the vectorization target.

This transformation supports the following attributes:

vectorize_padding: a UnitAttr to activate the vectorization of tensor.pad ops. Different pipelines may prefer to lower such ops to loops.
disable_multi_reduction_to_contract_patterns: a UnitAttr to deactivate the rewrite of vector.multi_reduction to vector.contract. This is intended to be used in tests only.
disable_transfer_permutation_map_lowering_patterns: a UnitAttr to deactivate the rewrite of vector.transfer with permutation maps into explicit vector.transpose operations. This is intended to be used in tests only but may be promoted to a first class attribute in the future.
Return modes: ¶
This operation produces a definite failure if vectorization fails for any reason. The operation always returns the handle to the target op that is expected to be isolated from above.
