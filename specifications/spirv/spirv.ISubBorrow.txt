spirv.ISubBorrow (spirv::ISubBorrowOp) ¶
Result is the unsigned integer subtraction of Operand 2 from Operand 1, and what it needed to borrow.

Result Type must be from OpTypeStruct. The struct must have two members, and the two members must be the same type. The member type must be a scalar or vector of integer type, whose Signedness operand is 0.

Operand 1 and Operand 2 must have the same type as the members of Result Type. These are consumed as unsigned integers.

Results are computed per component.

Member 0 of the result gets the low-order bits (full component width) of the subtraction. That is, if Operand 1 is larger than Operand 2, member 0 gets the full value of the subtraction; if Operand 2 is larger than Operand 1, member 0 gets 2w + Operand 1 - Operand 2, where w is the component width.

Member 1 of the result gets 0 if Operand 1 ≥ Operand 2, and gets 1 otherwise.

Example: ¶
%2 = spirv.ISubBorrow %0, %1 : !spirv.struct<(i32, i32)>
%2 = spirv.ISubBorrow %0, %1 : !spirv.struct<(vector<2xi32>, vector<2xi32>)>
