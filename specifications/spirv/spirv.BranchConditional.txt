spirv.BranchConditional (spirv::BranchConditionalOp) ¶
If Condition is true, branch to true block, otherwise branch to false block.

Condition must be a Boolean type scalar.

Branch weights are unsigned 32-bit integer literals. There must be either no Branch Weights or exactly two branch weights. If present, the first is the weight for branching to True Label, and the second is the weight for branching to False Label. The implied probability that a branch is taken is its weight divided by the sum of the two Branch weights. At least one weight must be non-zero. A weight of zero does not imply a branch is dead or permit its removal; branch weights are only hints. The two weights must not overflow a 32-bit unsigned integer when added together.

This instruction must be the last instruction in a block.
