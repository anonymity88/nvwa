spirv.mlir.selection (spirv::SelectionOp) ¶
Define a structured selection.

SPIR-V can explicitly declare structured control-flow constructs using merge instructions. These explicitly declare a header block before the control flow diverges and a merge block where control flow subsequently converges. These blocks delimit constructs that must nest, and can only be entered and exited in structured ways. See “2.11. Structured Control Flow” of the SPIR-V spec for more details.

Instead of having a spirv.SelectionMerge op to directly model selection merge instruction for indicating the merge target, we use regions to delimit the boundary of the selection: the merge target is the next op following the spirv.mlir.selection op. This way it’s easier to discover all blocks belonging to the selection and it plays nicer with the MLIR system.

The spirv.mlir.selection region should contain at least two blocks: one selection header block, and one selection merge. The selection header block should be the first block. The selection merge block should be the last block. The merge block should only contain a spirv.mlir.merge op.
