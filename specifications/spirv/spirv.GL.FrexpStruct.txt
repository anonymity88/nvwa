spirv.GL.FrexpStruct (spirv::GLFrexpStructOp) ¶
Splits x into two components such that x = significand * 2^exponent

Syntax:

operation ::= `spirv.GL.FrexpStruct` attr-dict $operand `:` type($operand) `->` type($result)
Result is a structure containing x split into a floating-point significand in the range (-1.0, 0.5] or [0.5, 1.0) and an integral exponent of 2, such that:

x = significand * 2^exponent

If x is a zero, the exponent is 0.0. If x is an infinity or a NaN, the exponent is undefined. If x is 0.0, the significand is 0.0. If x is -0.0, the significand is -0.0

Result Type must be an OpTypeStruct with two members. Member 0 must have the same type as the type of x. Member 0 holds the significand. Member 1 must be a scalar or vector with integer component type, with 32-bit component width. Member 1 holds the exponent. These two members and x must have the same number of components.

The operand x must be a scalar or vector whose component type is floating-point.

Example: ¶
%2 = spirv.GL.FrexpStruct %0 : f32 -> !spirv.struct<f32, i32>
%3 = spirv.GL.FrexpStruct %0 : vector<3xf32> -> !spirv.struct<vector<3xf32>, vector<3xi32>>
