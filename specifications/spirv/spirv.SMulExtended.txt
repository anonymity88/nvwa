spirv.SMulExtended (spirv::SMulExtendedOp) ¶
Result is the full value of the signed integer multiplication of Operand 1 and Operand 2.

Result Type must be from OpTypeStruct. The struct must have two members, and the two members must be the same type. The member type must be a scalar or vector of integer type.

Operand 1 and Operand 2 must have the same type as the members of Result Type. These are consumed as signed integers.

Results are computed per component.

Member 0 of the result gets the low-order bits of the multiplication.

Member 1 of the result gets the high-order bits of the multiplication.

Example: ¶
%2 = spirv.SMulExtended %0, %1 : !spirv.struct<(i32, i32)>
%2 = spirv.SMulExtended %0, %1 : !spirv.struct<(vector<2xi32>, vector<2xi32>)>
