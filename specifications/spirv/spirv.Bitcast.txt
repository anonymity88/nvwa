spirv.Bitcast (spirv::BitcastOp) ¶
Bit pattern-preserving type conversion.

Syntax:

operation ::= `spirv.Bitcast` $operand attr-dict `:` type($operand) `to` type($result)
Result Type must be an OpTypePointer, or a scalar or vector of numerical-type.

Operand must have a type of OpTypePointer, or a scalar or vector of numerical-type. It must be a different type than Result Type.

If either Result Type or Operand is a pointer, the other must be a pointer (diverges from the SPIR-V spec).

If Result Type has a different number of components than Operand, the total number of bits in Result Type must equal the total number of bits in Operand. Let L be the type, either Result Type or Operand’s type, that has the larger number of components. Let S be the other type, with the smaller number of components. The number of components in L must be an integer multiple of the number of components in S. The first component (that is, the only or lowest-numbered component) of S maps to the first components of L, and so on, up to the last component of S mapping to the last components of L. Within this mapping, any single component of S (mapping to multiple components of L) maps its lower- ordered bits to the lower-numbered components of L.

Example: ¶
%1 = spirv.Bitcast %0 : f32 to i32
%1 = spirv.Bitcast %0 : vector<2xf32> to i64
%1 = spirv.Bitcast %0 : !spirv.ptr<f32, Function> to !spirv.ptr<i32, Function>
