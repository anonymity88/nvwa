spirv.VectorInsertDynamic (spirv::VectorInsertDynamicOp) ¶
Make a copy of a vector, with a single, variably selected, component modified.

Syntax:

operation ::= `spirv.VectorInsertDynamic` $component `,` $vector `[` $index `]` attr-dict `:` type($vector) `,` type($index)
Result Type must be an OpTypeVector.

Vector must have the same type as Result Type and is the vector that the non-written components are copied from.

Component is the value supplied for the component selected by Index. It must have the same type as the type of components in Result Type.

Index must be a scalar integer. It is interpreted as a 0-based index of which component to modify.

Behavior is undefined if Index’s value is less than zero or greater than or equal to the number of components in Vector.

Example: ¶
%scalar = ... : f32
%2 = spirv.VectorInsertDynamic %scalar %0[%1] : f32, vector<8xf32>, i32
