Debug Info ¶
Debug information within the LLVM dialect is represented using locations in combination with a set of attributes that mirror the DINode structure defined by the debug info metadata within LLVM IR. Debug scoping information is attached to LLVM IR dialect operations using a fused location (FusedLoc) whose metadata holds the DIScopeAttr representing the debug scope. Similarly, the subprogram of LLVM IR dialect FuncOp operations is attached using a fused location whose metadata is a DISubprogramAttr.
