sparse_tensor.print (sparse_tensor::PrintOp) ¶
Prints a sparse tensor (for testing and debugging)

Syntax:

operation ::= `sparse_tensor.print` $tensor attr-dict `:` type($tensor)
Prints the individual components of a sparse tensors (the positions, coordinates, and values components) to stdout for testing and debugging purposes. This operation lowers to just a few primitives in a light-weight runtime support to simplify supporting this operation on new platforms.

Example:

sparse_tensor.print %tensor : tensor<1024x1024xf64, #CSR>
