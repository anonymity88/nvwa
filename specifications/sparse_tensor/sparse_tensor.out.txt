sparse_tensor.out (sparse_tensor::OutOp) ¶
Outputs a sparse tensor to the given destination

Syntax:

operation ::= `sparse_tensor.out` $tensor `,` $dest attr-dict `:` type($tensor) `,` type($dest)
Outputs the contents of a sparse tensor to the destination defined by an opaque pointer provided by dest. For targets that have access to a file system, for example, this pointer may specify a filename (or file) for output. The form of the operation is kept deliberately very general to allow for alternative implementations in the future, such as sending the contents to a buffer defined by a pointer.

Note that this operation is “impure” in the sense that its behavior is solely defined by side-effects and not SSA values.

Example:

sparse_tensor.out %t, %dest : tensor<1024x1024xf64, #CSR>, !Dest
Operands: ¶
