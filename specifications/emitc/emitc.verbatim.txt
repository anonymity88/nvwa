emitc.verbatim (emitc::VerbatimOp) ¶
Verbatim operation

Syntax:

operation ::= `emitc.verbatim` $value attr-dict
The emitc.verbatim operation produces no results and the value is emitted as is followed by a line break (’\n’ character) during translation.

Note: Use with caution. This operation can have arbitrary effects on the semantics of the emitted code. Use semantically more meaningful operations whenever possible. Additionally this op is NOT intended to be used to inject large snippets of code.

This operation can be used in situations where a more suitable operation is not yet implemented in the dialect or where preprocessor directives interfere with the structure of the code. One example of this is to declare the linkage of external symbols to make the generated code usable in both C and C++ contexts:

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif

...

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif
