emitc.if (emitc::IfOp) ¶
If-then-else operation

The emitc.if operation represents an if-then-else construct for conditionally executing two regions of code. The operand to an if operation is a boolean value. For example:

emitc.if %b  {
  ...
} else {
  ...
}
The “then” region has exactly 1 block. The “else” region may have 0 or 1 blocks. The blocks are always terminated with emitc.yield, which can be left out to be inserted implicitly. This operation doesn’t produce any results.
