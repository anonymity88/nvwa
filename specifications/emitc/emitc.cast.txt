emitc.cast (emitc::CastOp) ¶
Cast operation

Syntax:

operation ::= `emitc.cast` $source attr-dict `:` type($source) `to` type($dest)
The emitc.cast operation performs an explicit type conversion and is emitted as a C-style cast expression. It can be applied to integer, float, index and EmitC types.

Example:

// Cast from `int32_t` to `float`
%0 = emitc.cast %arg0: i32 to f32

// Cast from `void` to `int32_t` pointer
%1 = emitc.cast %arg1 :
    !emitc.ptr<!emitc.opaque<"void">> to !emitc.ptr<i32>
