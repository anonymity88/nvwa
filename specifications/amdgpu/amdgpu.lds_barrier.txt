amdgpu.lds_barrier (amdgpu::LDSBarrierOp) Â¶
Barrier that includes a wait for LDS memory operations.

Syntax:

operation ::= `amdgpu.lds_barrier` attr-dict
amdgpu.lds_barrier is both a barrier (all workitems in a workgroup must reach the barrier before any of them may proceed past it) and a wait for all operations that affect the Local Data Store (LDS) issued from that wrokgroup to complete before the workgroup may continue. Since the LDS is per-workgroup memory, this barrier may be used, for example, to ensure all workitems have written data to LDS before any workitem attempts to read from it.

Note that lds_barrier does not force reads to or from global memory to complete before execution continues. Therefore, it should be used when operations on global memory can be issued far in advance of when their results are used (for example, by writing them to LDS).

WARNING: On architectures that do not support the BackOffBarrier feature, (those which will implement this barrier by emitting inline assembly), use of this operation will impede the usabiliity of memory watches (including breakpoints set on variables) when debugging.
