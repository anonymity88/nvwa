Syntax:

operation ::= `acc.atomic.write` $x `=` $expr

              attr-dict
This operation performs an atomic write.

The operand x is the address to where the expr is atomically written w.r.t. multiple threads. The evaluation of expr need not be atomic w.r.t. the write to address. In general, the type(x) must dereference to type(expr).
