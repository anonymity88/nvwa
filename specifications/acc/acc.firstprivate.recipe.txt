acc.firstprivate.recipe (acc::FirstprivateRecipeOp) ¶
Privatization recipe

Syntax:

operation ::= `acc.firstprivate.recipe` $sym_name `:` $type attr-dict-with-keyword `init` $initRegion
              `copy` $copyRegion
              (`destroy` $destroyRegion^)?
Declares an OpenACC privatization recipe with copy of the initial value. The operation requires two mandatory regions and one optional.

The initializer region specifies how to allocate and initialize a new private value. For example in Fortran, a derived-type might have a default initialization. The region has an argument that contains the value that need to be privatized. This is useful if the type is not known at compile time and the private value is needed to create its copy.
The copy region specifies how to copy the initial value to the newly created private value. It takes the initial value and the privatized value as arguments.
The destroy region specifies how to destruct the value when it reaches its end of life. It takes the privatized value as argument. It is optional.
A single privatization recipe can be used for multiple operand if they have the same type and do not require a specific default initialization.

Example:

acc.firstprivate.recipe @privatization_f32 : f32 init {
^bb0(%0: f32):
  // init region contains a sequence of operations to create and
  // initialize the copy if needed. It yields the create copy.
} copy {
^bb0(%0: f32, %1: !llvm.ptr):
  // copy region contains a sequence of operations to copy the initial value
  // of the firstprivate value to the newly created value.
} destroy {
^bb0(%0: f32)
  // destroy region contains a sequences of operations to destruct the
  // created copy.
}

// The privatization symbol is then used in the corresponding operation.
acc.parallel firstprivate(@privatization_f32 -> %a : f32) {
}
