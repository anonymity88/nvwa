acc.atomic.update (acc::AtomicUpdateOp) ¶
Performs an atomic update

Syntax:

operation ::= `acc.atomic.update` $x `:` type($x) $region attr-dict
This operation performs an atomic update.

The operand x is exactly the same as the operand x in the OpenACC Standard (OpenACC 3.3, section 2.12). It is the address of the variable that is being updated. x is atomically read/written.

The region describes how to update the value of x. It takes the value at x as an input and must yield the updated value. Only the update to x is atomic. Generally the region must have only one instruction, but can potentially have more than one instructions too. The update is sematically similar to a compare-exchange loop based atomic update.

The syntax of atomic update operation is different from atomic read and atomic write operations. This is because only the host dialect knows how to appropriately update a value. For example, while generating LLVM IR, if there are no special atomicrmw instructions for the operation-type combination in atomic update, a compare-exchange loop is generated, where the core update operation is directly translated like regular operations by the host dialect. The front-end must handle semantic checks for allowed operations.
