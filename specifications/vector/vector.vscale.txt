vector.vscale (vector::VectorScaleOp) ¶
Load vector scale size

Syntax:

operation ::= `vector.vscale` attr-dict
The vscale op returns the scale of the scalable vectors, a positive integer value that is constant at runtime but unknown at compile-time. The scale of the vector indicates the multiplicity of the vectors and vector operations. For example, a vector<[4]xi32> is equivalent to vscale consecutive vector<4xi32>; and an operation on a vector<[4]xi32> is equivalent to performing that operation vscale times, once on each <4xi32> segment of the scalable vector. The vscale op can be used to calculate the step in vector-length agnostic (VLA) loops. Right now we only support one contiguous set of scalable dimensions, all of them grouped and scaled with the value returned by ‘vscale’.
