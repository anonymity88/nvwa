linalg.dot (linalg::DotOp)
Performs a dot product of two vectors to a scalar result.

Numeric casting is performed on the operands to the inner multiply, promoting them to the same data type as the accumulator/output. Traits: AttrSizedOperandSegments, SingleBlockImplicitTerminator<YieldOp>, SingleBlock
