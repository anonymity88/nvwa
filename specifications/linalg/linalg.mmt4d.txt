linalg.mmt4d (linalg::Mmt4DOp)
Performs a matrix-matrix-transpose multiplication of two 4D inputs.

Differences from linalg.matmul:

The right hand side is transposed, whence the ’t’ in ‘mmt’.
The input and output tensors have a 4D shape instead of a 2D shape. They are interpreted as 2D matrices with one level of 2D tile subdivision, whence the 2+2=4 dimensions. The inner tile dimensions are identified with ‘0’ suffixes below, for instance the LHS matrix shape (M, K, M0, K0) reads as: MxK tiles, each of shape M0xK0.
