linalg.max (linalg::MaxOp)
Takes the max (signed) between two inputs, elementwise.

The shapes and element types must be identical. The appropriate casts, broadcasts and reductions should be done previously to calling this op.

This means reduction/broadcast/element cast semantics is explicit. Further passes can take that into account when lowering this code. For example, a linalg.broadcast + linalg.max sequence can be lowered to a linalg.generic with different affine maps for the two operands.
