linalg.quantized_batch_matmul (linalg::QuantizedBatchMatmulOp)
Performs a batched matrix multiplication of two 3D inputs.

Numeric casting is performed on the operands to the inner multiply, promoting them to the same data type as the accumulator/output. The quantized variant includes zero-point adjustments for the left and right operands of the matmul. Traits: AttrSizedOperandSegments, SingleBlockImplicitTerminator<YieldOp>, SingleBlock
