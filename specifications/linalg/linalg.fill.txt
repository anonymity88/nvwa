linalg.fill (linalg::FillOp)
Fills the output tensor with the given value.

Works for arbitrary ranked output tensors since the operation performs scalar accesses only and is thus rank polymorphic. Numeric casting is performed on the value operand, promoting it to the same data type as the output. Traits: AttrSizedOperandSegments, SingleBlockImplicitTerminator<YieldOp>, SingleBlock

Interfaces: ConditionallySpeculatable, DestinationStyleOpInterface, LinalgFillOpInterface, LinalgStructuredInterface, MemoryEffectOpInterface, ReifyRankedShapedTypeOpInterface
