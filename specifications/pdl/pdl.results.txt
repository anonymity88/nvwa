pdl.results (pdl::ResultsOp) ¶
Extract a result group from an operation

Syntax:

operation ::= `pdl.results` ($index^)? `of` $parent custom<ResultsValueType>(ref($index), type($val))
              attr-dict
pdl.results operations extract a result group from an operation within a pattern or rewrite region. If an index is provided, this operation extracts a result group as defined by the ODS definition of the operation. In this case the result of this operation may be either a single pdl.value or a pdl.range<value>, depending on the constraint of the result in ODS. If no index is provided, this operation extracts the full result range of the operation.

Example:

// Extract all of the results of an operation:
%operation = pdl.operation ...
%results = pdl.results of %operation

// Extract the results in the first result group of an operation, which is
// variadic:
%operation = pdl.operation ...
%results = pdl.results 0 of %operation -> !pdl.range<value>

// Extract the results in the second result group of an operation, which is
// not variadic:
%operation = pdl.operation ...
%results = pdl.results 1 of %operation -> !pdl.value
