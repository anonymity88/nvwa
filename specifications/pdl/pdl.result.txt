pdl.result (pdl::ResultOp) ¶
Extract a result from an operation

Syntax:

operation ::= `pdl.result` $index `of` $parent attr-dict
pdl.result operations extract result edges from an operation node within a pattern or rewrite region. The provided index is zero-based, and represents the concrete result to extract, i.e. this is not the result index as defined by the ODS definition of the operation.

Example:

// Extract a result:
%operation = pdl.operation ...
%pdl_result = pdl.result 1 of %operation

// Imagine the following IR being matched:
%result_0, %result_1 = foo.op ...

// If the example pattern snippet above were matching against `foo.op` in
// the IR snippet, `%pdl_result` would correspond to `%result_1`.
