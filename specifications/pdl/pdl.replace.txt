pdl.replace (pdl::ReplaceOp) ¶
Mark an input operation as replaced

Syntax:

operation ::= `pdl.replace` $opValue `with` (`(` $replValues^ `:` type($replValues) `)`)?
              ($replOperation^)? attr-dict
pdl.replace operations are used within pdl.rewrite regions to specify that an input operation should be marked as replaced. The semantics of this operation correspond with the replaceOp method on a PatternRewriter. The set of replacement values can be either:

a single Operation (replOperation should be populated)
The operation will be replaced with the results of this operation.
a set of Values (replValues should be populated)
The operation will be replaced with these values.
Example:

// Replace root node with 2 values:
pdl.replace %root with (%val0, %val1 : !pdl.value, !pdl.value)

// Replace root node with a range of values:
pdl.replace %root with (%vals : !pdl.range<value>)

// Replace root with another operation:
pdl.replace %root with %otherOp
