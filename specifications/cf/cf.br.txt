Branch operation

Syntax:

operation ::= `cf.br` $dest (`(` $destOperands^ `:` type($destOperands) `)`)? attr-dict
The cf.br operation represents a direct branch operation to a given block. The operands of this operation are forwarded to the successor block, and the number and type of the operands must match the arguments of the target block.

Example:

^bb2:
  %2 = call @someFn()
  cf.br ^bb3(%2 : tensor<*xf32>)
^bb3(%3: tensor<*xf32>):
