xegpu.fence (xegpu::FenceOp) ¶
It synchronizes memory accesses.

Syntax:

operation ::= `xegpu.fence` `memory_kind` `=` `` $memory_kind `,` `fence_scope` `=` `` $fence_scope attr-dict
It synchronizes the memory access between write and following read or write. 1. Memory_kind describes the memory kind. “global” means the global memory, “slm” means the share local memory. 2. Fence_scope describes the scope of fence. “Workgroup” means that the scope would be within each workgroup. “GPU” means the scope would be across workgroups within the GPU.
