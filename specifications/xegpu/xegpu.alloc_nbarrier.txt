xegpu.alloc_nbarrier (xegpu::AllocNbarrierOp) ¶
It allocates a set of named barriers.

Syntax:

operation ::= `xegpu.alloc_nbarrier` $nbarrier_num attr-dict
AllocNbarrier is to create a set of named barriers as specified by nbarrier_num. Named barriers are workgroup level resources, and are shared by all threads in the workgroup. For example, there are up to 32 barriers (range 0-31) for each XeCore on PVC. A typical use case is that a workgroup is partitioned into N subgroups of threads (N <= 32), and each subgroup coordinating their work with a separate barrier with id range from 0 to N respectively.
