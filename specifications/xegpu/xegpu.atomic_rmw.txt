xegpu.atomic_rmw (xegpu::AtomicRMWOp) ¶
Atomic ready-modify-write operation on the TensorDesc.

Syntax:

operation ::= `xegpu.atomic_rmw` $kind $tensorDesc `,` $mask `,` $value attr-dict `:`
              qualified(type($tensorDesc)) `,` type($mask) `,` type($value) `->` type($result)
The xegpu.atomic_rmw operation provides a way to perform a read-modify-write operation on the region described by the TensorDesc free from data races. The kind enumeration specifies the modification to be performed, The mask operand has the same shape with TensorDesc, and is used to enable or disable specific data points of the TensorDesc. The value operand represents the new value to be applied during the modification.
