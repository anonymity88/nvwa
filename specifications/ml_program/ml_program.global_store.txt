ml_program.global_store (ml_program::GlobalStoreOp) ¶
Direct store of a value into a mutable global

Syntax:

operation ::= `ml_program.global_store` $global `=` $value `:` type($value) attr-dict
Performs a non-atomic, non-volatile, non-synchronized store to a mutable global.

It is fully expected that these constraints are not suitable for all situations, and alternative ops should be defined and used for more advanced cases.

This op is side effecting and may not be valid to use in graph regions without additional consideration to evaluation order constraints. See global_store_graph for op which allows for explicit ordering constraints.

Example:

ml_program.global_store @foobar = %0 : tensor<?xi32>
