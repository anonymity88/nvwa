polynomial.add (polynomial::AddOp) ¶
Addition operation between polynomials.

Syntax:

operation ::= `polynomial.add` operands attr-dict `:` type($result)
Performs polynomial addition on the operands. The operands may be single polynomials or containers of identically-typed polynomials, i.e., polynomials from the same underlying ring with the same coefficient types.

Addition is defined to occur in the ring defined by the ring attribute of the two operands, meaning the addition is taken modulo the coefficientModulus and the polynomialModulus of the ring.

Example:

// add two polynomials modulo x^1024 - 1
#poly = #polynomial.int_polynomial<x**1024 - 1>
#ring = #polynomial.ring<coefficientType=i32, coefficientModulus=65536:i32, polynomialModulus=#poly>
%0 = polynomial.constant int<1 + x**2> : !polynomial.polynomial<#ring>
%1 = polynomial.constant int<x**5 - x + 1> : !polynomial.polynomial<#ring>
%2 = polynomial.add %0, %1 : !polynomial.polynomial<#ring>
