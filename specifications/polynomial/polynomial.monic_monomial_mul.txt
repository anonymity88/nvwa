polynomial.monic_monomial_mul (polynomial::MonicMonomialMulOp) ¶
Multiply a polynomial by a monic monomial.

Syntax:

operation ::= `polynomial.monic_monomial_mul` operands attr-dict `:` functional-type(operands, results)
Multiply a polynomial by a monic monomial, meaning a polynomial of the form 1 * x^k for an index operand k.

In some special rings of polynomials, such as a ring of polynomials modulo x^n - 1, monomial_mul can be interpreted as a cyclic shift of the coefficients of the polynomial. For some rings, this results in optimized lowerings that involve rotations and rescaling of the coefficients of the input.
