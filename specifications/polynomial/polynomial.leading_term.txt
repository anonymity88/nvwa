polynomial.leading_term (polynomial::LeadingTermOp) ¶
Compute the leading term of the polynomial.

Syntax:

operation ::= `polynomial.leading_term` operands attr-dict `:` type($input) `->` `(` type($degree) `,` type($coefficient) `)`
The degree of a polynomial is the largest k
 for which the coefficient a_k of x^k is nonzero. The leading term is the term a_k * x^k, which this op represents as a pair of results. The first is the degree k as an index, and the second is the coefficient, whose type matches the coefficient type of the polynomial’s ring attribute.

Example:

#poly = #polynomial.int_polynomial<x**1024 - 1>
#ring = #polynomial.ring<coefficientType=i32, coefficientModulus=65536:i32, polynomialModulus=#poly>
%0 = polynomial.constant int<1 + x**2> : !polynomial.polynomial<#ring>
%1, %2 = polynomial.leading_term %0 : !polynomial.polynomial<#ring> -> (index, i32)
