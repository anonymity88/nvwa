nvgpu.device_async_create_group (nvgpu::DeviceAsyncCreateGroupOp) ¶
Device side asynchronous create group operation

Syntax:

operation ::= `nvgpu.device_async_create_group` $inputTokens attr-dict
The nvgpu.device_async_create_group op creates a group of memory accesses containing all the pending device_async_copy operations associated with argument tokens. Each token can only be part of one group.

It returns a token that can be use to wait until the group fully completes.

This is meant to be used with nvgpu.device_async_wait to synchronize copies as explained in those ops descriptions.

Groups are executed in the order they are created.

Example:

%0 = nvgpu.device_async_create_group
