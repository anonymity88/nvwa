nvgpu.device_async_wait (nvgpu::DeviceAsyncWaitOp) ¶
Wait for async gpu ops to complete.

Syntax:

operation ::= `nvgpu.device_async_wait` $asyncDependencies attr-dict
The nvgpu.device_async_wait op will block the execution thread until the group associated with the source token is fully completed.

The optional $numGroups attribute gives an upper bound of the number of groups uncompleted when the wait can unblock the thread. For example, if 16 async groups are pushe and $numGroups is set to 12, then the thread will unblock when 12 groups or fewer are in flight (4 groups have completed).

Example:

nvgpu.device_async_wait %0
