mpi.init (mpi::InitOp) ¶
Initialize the MPI library, equivalent to MPI_Init(NULL, NULL)

Syntax:

operation ::= `mpi.init` attr-dict (`:` type($retval)^)?
This operation must preceed most MPI calls (except for very few exceptions, please consult with the MPI specification on these).

Passing &argc, &argv is not supported currently.

This operation can optionally return an !mpi.retval value that can be used to check for errors.
