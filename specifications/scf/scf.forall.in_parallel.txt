scf.forall.in_parallel (scf::InParallelOp) Â¶
Terminates a forall block

The scf.forall.in_parallel is a designated terminator for the scf.forall operation.

It has a single region with a single block that contains a flat list of ops. Each such op participates in the aggregate formation of a single result of the enclosing scf.forall. The result number corresponds to the position of the op in the terminator.
