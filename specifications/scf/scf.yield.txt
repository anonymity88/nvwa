scf.yield (scf::YieldOp) ¶
Loop yield and termination operation

Syntax:

operation ::= `scf.yield` attr-dict ($results^ `:` type($results))?
The scf.yield operation yields an SSA value from the SCF dialect op region and terminates the regions. The semantics of how the values are yielded is defined by the parent operation. If scf.yield has any operands, the operands must match the parent operation’s results. If the parent operation defines no values, then the scf.yield may be left out in the custom syntax and the builders will insert one implicitly. Otherwise, it has to be present in the syntax to indicate which values are yielded.
